## Decision Gate Evaluation

**Success Criteria**: Sharpe improvement ≥0.3

**Actual Sharpe Improvement**: 0.5211

**Status**: ✅ **CRITERIA MET**

### Verdict

✅ **PROCEED TO PHASE 1 (Exit Strategy Mutation MVP)**

**Rationale**:
- Exit strategies improved Sharpe ratio by 0.5211 (-428.9%)
- Improvement meets minimum threshold of 0.3
- Hypothesis validated: Sophisticated exits significantly improve performance

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 1: Implement ExitStrategyMutationOperator
2. Build AST-based exit logic mutation framework
3. Run 20-generation smoke test validation
4. Target: Sharpe >2.0 for full Phase 2 approval

## Detailed Analysis

### REQ-6 Expected Impact Validation

**Conservative Estimates** (from requirements.md):
- Sharpe Ratio: +0.3 to +0.8 improvement (20-60% increase)
- Max Drawdown: -15% to -40% reduction
- Win Rate: +5% to +15% increase

**Actual Results**:
- Sharpe Ratio: +0.5211 (-428.9%) ✅ Within expectations
- Max Drawdown: +1.68% (+2.3%) ⚠️ Outside expectations

### Exit Mechanism Performance

**Implemented Exit Strategies**:
1. **ATR Trailing Stop-Loss**: 2× ATR below highest high since entry
   - Risk management through volatility-adjusted stops
   - Cuts losing trades at ~10% typical loss on 5% ATR

2. **Fixed Profit Target**: 3× ATR above entry price
   - Systematic profit capture using risk-adjusted targets
   - Captures +15% typical profit on 5% ATR (3:1 risk:reward)

3. **Time-Based Exit**: Maximum 30 trading days
   - Prevents stale positions and capital lock-up
   - Forces reallocation of capital to fresh opportunities
