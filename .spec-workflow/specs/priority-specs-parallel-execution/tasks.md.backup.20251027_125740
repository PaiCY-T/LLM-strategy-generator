## Control Spec Tasks

### Task 1: Create Status Aggregation Script

- [x] 1. Create status aggregation script in `scripts/check_priority_specs_status.py`
  - File: `scripts/check_priority_specs_status.py`
  - Read all 4 specs' tasks.md files
  - Parse task completion status ([ ], [-], [x])
  - Generate aggregated table with completed/total/percentage
  - Purpose: Single command to see overall progress
  - _Leverage: Python stdlib (no dependencies), regex for parsing markdown_
  - _Requirements: 3.1 (Timeline Tracking)_
  - _Prompt: Role: DevOps Engineer with expertise in Python scripting and automation | Task: Create a status aggregation script that reads all 4 priority specs' tasks.md files (.spec-workflow/specs/{exit-mutation-redesign, llm-integration-activation, structured-innovation-mvp, yaml-normalizer-phase2-complete-normalization}/tasks.md), parses task completion markers ([ ] = pending, [-] = in-progress, [x] = completed), and outputs a formatted table showing spec name, completed tasks, total tasks, and percentage for each spec plus overall totals. Follow requirement 3.1 for timeline tracking. First run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md, implement the script, and mark as complete when done. | Restrictions: Do not use external dependencies beyond Python stdlib, must handle missing files gracefully, do not hardcode paths (use relative paths from project root), ensure output is parseable by CI/CD systems | Success: Script runs successfully and displays accurate status for all 4 specs, handles missing files with clear error messages, output is readable by humans and machines, can be run from any directory in the project_
  - Estimated: 1h

### Task 2: Create Dependency Validation Script

- [x] 2. Create dependency validation script in `scripts/validate_spec_dependencies.py`
  - File: `scripts/validate_spec_dependencies.py`
  - Load dependency matrix from this tasks.md (parse from Markdown)
  - Perform topological sort to detect circular dependencies
  - Validate that in-progress tasks have prerequisites completed
  - Purpose: Prevent dependency violations during parallel execution
  - _Leverage: Python stdlib (graphlib for topological sort)_
  - _Requirements: 1.5 (Dependency Matrix)_
  - _Prompt: Role: Software Architect with expertise in dependency analysis and graph algorithms | Task: Create a dependency validation script that extracts the dependency matrix from this control spec's tasks.md (Dependency Matrix section), uses Python's graphlib.TopologicalSorter to detect circular dependencies, and validates that any task marked as in-progress [-] has all its prerequisite tasks marked as completed [x]. Follow requirement 1.5 for dependency validation. First run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md, implement the script, and mark as complete when done. | Restrictions: Must parse dependency matrix from Markdown (do not hardcode), handle missing dependencies gracefully, must report exact cycle path if circular dependency found, do not modify any tasks.md files | Success: Script correctly identifies circular dependencies with exact cycle path, validates prerequisite completion before allowing task to start, outputs clear validation errors with actionable messages, can be integrated into pre-commit hooks_
  - Estimated: 1h

### Task 3: Create Timeline Calculator Script

- [ ] 3. Create timeline calculator in `scripts/calculate_parallel_timeline.py`
  - File: `scripts/calculate_parallel_timeline.py`
  - Read dependency matrix and task estimates from all 4 specs
  - Calculate critical path (longest sequence of dependent tasks)
  - Generate day-by-day schedule with parallel tracks
  - Purpose: Predict completion date and identify bottlenecks
  - _Leverage: Python stdlib, dependency matrix from Task 2_
  - _Requirements: 1.3 (Critical Path Identification)_
  - _Prompt: Role: Project Manager with expertise in critical path analysis and scheduling algorithms | Task: Create a timeline calculator that reads dependency matrix and task estimates from all 4 specs' tasks.md files, calculates the critical path (longest chain of dependencies), and generates a day-by-day schedule showing which tasks run in parallel on each day. Follow requirement 1.3 for critical path identification. Use the dependency parsing from Task 2's validation script. First run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md, implement the script, and mark as complete when done. | Restrictions: Must account for resource conflicts (same role cannot work on 2 tasks simultaneously), use 8h work days, clearly identify which track is the critical path, do not assume infinite parallelism | Success: Script correctly identifies Track 3 as the critical path (2 days), generates accurate 5-day timeline matching this spec's plan, flags resource conflicts, provides ETA updates as tasks complete_
  - Estimated: 1.5h

### Task 4: Create Automated Sync Script

- [ ] 4. Create sync script in `scripts/sync_control_spec_status.py`
  - File: `scripts/sync_control_spec_status.py`
  - Read completion status from all 4 individual specs
  - Compare with control spec's timeline
  - Detect drift (tasks completed out of expected order)
  - Update control spec's "Current Status" section
  - Purpose: Keep control spec synchronized with actual progress
  - _Leverage: Status aggregation from Task 1_
  - _Requirements: 5.2 (Control Spec Updates)_
  - _Prompt: Role: Automation Engineer with expertise in data synchronization and Python scripting | Task: Create a sync script that reads completion status from all 4 individual specs' tasks.md files, compares with the expected timeline in this control spec, detects anomalies (e.g., Task 8 completed before Task 7), and updates the "Current Status" section in this tasks.md with actual progress. Follow requirement 5.2 for keeping control spec in sync. Leverage the status aggregation logic from Task 1. First run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md, implement the script, and mark as complete when done. | Restrictions: Must preserve all other sections of tasks.md (only update "Current Status"), detect but do not auto-fix dependency violations (require manual review), must handle concurrent updates gracefully, create backup before editing | Success: Script accurately detects completion status discrepancies, updates control spec without corrupting Markdown format, alerts on dependency violations, can run as daily cron job_
  - Estimated: 1.5h

### Task 5: Integration Testing and Documentation

- [ ] 5. Create integration tests and usage documentation
  - File: `tests/control_spec/test_priority_specs_orchestration.py` + `docs/PRIORITY_SPECS_CONTROL.md`
  - Write integration tests for all 4 control spec scripts
  - Document usage workflow (how to check status, validate dependencies, update timeline)
  - Create troubleshooting guide (common errors, resolution steps)
  - Purpose: Ensure control spec tools are reliable and usable
  - _Leverage: pytest for testing, existing docs templates_
  - _Requirements: All (comprehensive validation)_
  - _Prompt: Role: QA Engineer with expertise in integration testing and technical documentation | Task: Create comprehensive integration tests for the 4 control spec scripts (check_priority_specs_status.py, validate_spec_dependencies.py, calculate_parallel_timeline.py, sync_control_spec_status.py) using pytest, and write user documentation in docs/PRIORITY_SPECS_CONTROL.md explaining how to use the control spec system, check progress, validate dependencies, and troubleshoot common issues. Cover all requirements. First run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide, then mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md, implement tests and docs, and mark as complete when done. | Restrictions: Tests must not modify actual spec files (use fixtures), must test error cases (missing files, circular dependencies), documentation must be beginner-friendly, include CLI examples with expected output | Success: All scripts have >80% test coverage, integration tests pass reliably, documentation is clear and comprehensive with examples, troubleshooting guide covers all known error scenarios_
  - Estimated: 2h
