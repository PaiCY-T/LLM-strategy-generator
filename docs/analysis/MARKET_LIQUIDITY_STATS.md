   - Large cap: 105 stocks (25.6%)
   - Mid cap: 231 stocks (56.3%)
   - Small cap: 74 stocks (18.0%)
   - 💡 Good balance of mid-cap opportunities

3. **Threshold Selection Guidance**:

   - **50M TWD**: 803 stocks (30.5%) - Very liquid, may include volatile small caps
   - **100M TWD**: 599 stocks (22.8%) - Good balance of liquidity and quality

- **For large portfolios (>20 stocks)**: Use 100M TWD threshold (wider selection)
